            <h1>Welcome!!!</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the basic minecraft info website. Here you will find some information which is related to the game we know and love;
            Minecraft!!!
            </p>
            <p>You should know that this blog can no way provide every information related to minecraft.</p>
            <p>Minecraft is a huge brand and there are many many things which are associated with it. We lack resources and we also
                lack time to cover everything related to the game.
            </p>
            <p>But, this does not mean that we will not continue to update the resources as time passes by. It is and will be our duty to
                continue maintain and add new data into the database.
            </p>
            <p>I hope you enjoy the experience!!!</p>

            <h2>Lets Start</h2>
            <p>First thing First, We will start with information of some monsters present in the game. We will be covering the major monsters and
                not the ity bity ones. Here we go.
            </p>



            <div id="content">
            <h3>Monsters:</h3>
            <ul class="anchor-list">
                <li><a href="#zombie" onclick="display('zombie')">Zombie</a></li>
                <li><a href="#creeper" onclick="display('creeper')">Creeper</a></li>
                <li><a href="#skeleton" onclick="display('skeleton')">Skeleton</a></li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Zombie Section -->
            <div id="zombie">
            <h2><a name="zombie">Zombie:</a> </h2>
            <p>As the Sun sets over the horizon. You farantically look for sheeps and the woods and the coals so that you can spend your first
                night peacefully but, looks like it is too late. You hear groans in the distance and you know you are gonna have a tough night.</p>

            <p>These brainless monsters have been around minecraft for the longest time. With the capability of affecting the villagers and
                turning them into undeads is what makes them quite special. Although, if you are stacked up and have an armor and sword made
                iron, you dont have to wory about them that much, but this does not mean that you can sleep peacefully too. If they come in numbers
                then oh my you are up for a very very tough night.
            </p>

            <p>If you have your eyes on a particular village then make sure that you have secured it properly or else these guys will swarm it
                in the night, and all you will find in the morning burnt flesh and sadness.
            </p>

            <p>Spawning beneath the light level of 7, they are harmed from sunlight and will do anything to stay away from it. Make sure that
                your base is properly lit up or elsee......
            </p>
            </div>
            <!-- Creeper Section -->

            <div id="creeper">
            <h2><a name="creeper">Creeper: </h2></a>
            <p>You are furiously mining deep down into the ground. You have been working hard to get the required materials and finally you
                are about to reach the vertical level 11. You cannot wait to get your hands on those sweet sweet diamond. Suddenly you hear
                a sound, a sound which is quit familiar, a sound which resembles something frying in a pan. WAITTTTTT.....BOOOOM. It is too late.
                What is left behind is your tears and blood.
            </p>

            <p>My friend, that is right, you have just encountered Creeper.</p>
            <p>These green, sneaky, noisless four legged creature are probably the most hated and the most loved monsters at the same time.
                With the ability to explode, they are a nightmare for every person playing the game. Wether you have just decorated your sweet home
                or you have constructed a nice pen for your cows, these guys do not give a damn.
            </p>

            <p>What makes them special is their ability to noislessly sneak up behind the player and then explode. Destroying every thing in
                a radius of 5 to 6 blocks. They are not affected by sunlight and can be spotted easily in mornings and noons, and probably
                this is the reason why everybody is scared of them.
            </p>
            </div>



            <!-- Skeleton section -->
            <div id="skeleton">
            <h2><a name="skeleton">Skeleton: </h2></a>
            <p>These bony figures with bows in thier hands might be one of the coolest mobs in mineraft. Some would say that these guys might
                be the most OP creatures of minecraft. What makes them special is thier skill of bowing and arrowing. With the range of almost
                10 blocks skeletons can easily ruin someones day.
            </p>
            <p>They come in 2 Variants:
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Normal</li>
                    <li>Snowy</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>These guys are also affected by sunlight and will only spawn below light level of 7. These guys have a tough life because
                they not only have to defend themselves from the sunlight but also wolves too. They make a tasty meal for the wolves that is
                why they have to run for thier lives when they see one.
            </p>
            <p>They are very skilled in thier jobs and sometimes are so accurate that they will leave you mind blown.</p>
